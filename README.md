# Meetup Clone

We have Cloned an event organizing website called Meetup Clone.
Meetup is a service used to organize online groups that host in-person and virtual events for people with similar interests.
The platform enables users to browse the events on basis of interest and also they can organise their own event with both the web version and mobile apps. 

In this project , we have tried to make a perfect clone of meetup.com.
